      "It’s a magnificently surreal scene. A visibly agitated legend of the world game is heading out the theatre door for a smoke. But this is not the world stage, the sort he has graced in the past. This is a stage in Dundee – specifically, the city’s west end, where, following his own appearance, a production of Dick Whittington is due to begin a run. \n",
      "Caniggia’s already made a request for the pre-show music to be turned up rather than down in an effort to reduce the anxiety he says he is feeling before facing several hundred Dundee fans at a long awaited An Audience With A Global Superstar event.\n",
      "It seems this superstar functions best amid din and discord. \n",
      "Perhaps this should be expected of someone once stationed at the Bombonera, home to Boca Juniors and somewhere reckoned to be among the most raucous grounds in world football. Unusually, Caniggia once also turned out every second weekend at River Plate’s Estadio Monumental, another must-visit stadium known for its ear-splitting volume and the inhabitants’ fierce dislike of Boca Juniors. This was displayed in shameful fashion when the Boca Juniors team bus was attacked before the second leg of the Copa Libertadores final at the end of last month. \n",
      "Edinburgh did the needful last night, albeit opponents Newcastle had one eye on this match and the other on their precarious perch at the foot of the Premiership.\n",
      "The contest offered any number of match-ups. If the Fijians were having a carrying contest Edinburgh’s Bill Mata beat Tevita Cavubati, and his pass out the back of his hand for Blair Kinghorn’s late try was Michael Jordan-esque.\n",
      "Home No 9 Henry Pyrgos probably shaded the scrum-half kicking battle, threading a beauty into the south west corner even if he did overcook a box kick a little later. And the front row won their own battle within the wider war, comprehensively, even if they did wait until Edinburgh went 10-7 behind on the scoreboard before making it count with the first scrum penalty of the match. In the second half it was  a penalty try directly from a set scrum that finally put some distance between Edinburgh and the visitors, who clung on for longer than anyone expected.\n",
      "But the most intriguing head-to-head on show was the contest between the two opensides. Hamish Watson is Scotland’s acknowledged starter, Gary Graham the man who would be king.\n",

      "Boots Riley wraps a devastating critique of capitalism and racism in the US in a funny and entertaining cautionary tale, while Robert Redford bows out in style in his final screen role\n",
      "Sorry To Bother You (15) *****\n",
      "The Old Man & the Gun (12A) ****\n",
      "Released in the US without too much fanfare this past summer, musician-turned-filmmaker Boots Riley’s debut feature Sorry To Bother You has become a genuine phenomenon; a punky Sundance outlier transformed by word-of-mouth into the buzziest movie of the year. That’s appropriate given one of the many interlinked themes in this wild and audacious satirical side-swipe at racial politics and unfettered capitalism in 21st century America is the power of grassroots movements. But it’s also a mark of Riley’s sheer narrative chutzpah that the film never feels didactic as it crams a semester’s worth of radical politics into its swift 100-minute running time.\n",
      "Starting as a wry take-down of prejudice in the work place, the film introduces us to its broke black protagonist, Cassius “Cash” Green (Lakeith Stanfield), as he’s living in his uncle’s garage with his artist/activist girlfriend Detroit (Creed’s Tessa Thompson). Politically aware, but not politically active, he’s the sort of feckless millennial who’ll push back against demands for rent with half-hearted rhetoric about greedy landlords, even though the person demanding it is a charitable family member going above and beyond the call of duty by tolerating his post-adolescent existential funk. But with said uncle (played by Terry Crews) also facing eviction, Cash is soon forced to get a job. This being a heightened alternate version of contemporary Oakland – where opportunities for non-coders are thin on the ground and gentrification is making it too expensive to live – he ends up working in a call centre that will literally hire anyone who can operate a phone and stick to the script. \n",

      "George RR Martin has described Fire And Blood as his equivalent of JRR Tolkien’s The Silmarillion. It is a backstory, telling the events that happened in Westeros 300 years before the events in A Song Of Ice And Fire. But there are significant differences. Tolkien’s work was written before The Lord Of The Rings, submitted for publication, rejected and published posthumously. In addition, it dealt with god-like entities and creation myths. The rejection of The Silmarillion (“too Celtic” according to the publisher; actually ersatz Norse) spurred him into telling a different story in the world he had built. Martin’s work is an extension to the stories already told in various spin-off books – The World Of Ice And Fire, the various short stories in Rogues and Dangerous Women. It is as if, having built his sandpit and played with his toys for a time, he now has set himself to engrave, elaborately, the railway-sleepers of the framework. Most fans will pounce on the book; more would rather they have The Winds Of Winter. But with the television series having outstripped the novels, and with HBO announcing a prequel series, at least they will have a good deal of material with which to work.\n",
      "And it is work. With the novels comprising A Song Of Ice And Fire, Martin cleverly used a tightly focalised form, with the reader perched on the shoulder of different characters. It meant that readers developed an emotional attachment to what happened to Ned Stark, or Samwell Tarly, or Brienne of Tarth. Fire And Blood tacks in the opposite direction, and the best parts of it are about the history of the Targaryen dynasty. But could any reader feel any twinge of sympathy with sentences like “The lords and knights who came were largely westermen and riverlords; the Lords Tarbeck, Roote, Vance, Charlton, Frey, Paege, Parren, Farman, and Westerlings were among them too, together with Lord Corbray of the Vale, the Bastard of Barrowtown, and the fourth son of the Lord of Griffin’s Roost”. Tell me why I should care about what happens to any of them.\n",
      "The style affects a cod-archaic: “oft”, “ne’er”, “dastards”, “pot shops”, “member”. (Yes, despite some speeches in favour of female emancipation, there is still a great deal of rape, brothels, women dying in childbirth and suchlike). Many characters will intone in echoes of the King James Bible. Parts of it seem like rather juvenile in-jokes – calling a character Ser Kermit Tully and then having someone else comment that he is “as green as spring grass” is not perhaps the book’s most serious or interesting moment. A reference to “William Stackspear” is perhaps supposed to be funny in a book which features, among other incidents, someone being drowned in a vat of ale. I should add that the book has many illustrations, and they all look like the bad tattoos a second division footballer would have of his new paramour.  \n",
      "The most successful parts of it are the sometimes comically conflicting accounts of previous histories; one by the pious Archmaester Munkun, the other by a court fool called Mushroom. There are two plot lines across this sprawling book which stand out, and neither involves dragons. The first is a recurring obsession with religious fanaticism; time and again politics is pitted against theology. The second is a section towards the end when a foreign princess invites her relatives to set up, in effect, the first Ponzi scheme in Westeros.\n",
      "Towards the end I realised the game in which I was. This is a work of self-homage, and a sop to producers. We have a Stark coming to King’s Landing to solve a crime (Cregan, this time, not Ned). We have, in Mushroom, a cynical, lascivious, drunken and yet perceptive dwarf (Tyrion checked off). There is a brave, boisterous dragon-riding girl (that takes care of Arya and Daenarys). There is a sinister Lannister, wearing a silk mask to disguise his injuries, who is Hand of the King (can we call Charles Dance to see if he fancies a reprise? If not, at least we have a mask). One-handed knight – yup. Kings poisoned and royals who defenestrate themselves – all good to go. When I read the sentence that one of the supposed sources claims is “plausibly… the product of several hands for the style of the prose varies greatly from episode to episode”, I actually laughed aloud. But not in a good way. Readers keen to find out more about the mythology – the White Walkers, the Children of the Forest, what lies beyond the Sunset Sea, the Doom of Valyria – might find themselves disappointed.\n",
      "Eduardo Paolozzi and Andy Warhol were contemporaries. Born in 1928, Warhol was just four years the junior. Both were sons of first generation immigrants, but though that doesn’t seem to be refelcted in Warhol’s work, it was definitive in Paolozzi’s. One of his major works, Manuscript of Monte Cassino, is, for instance, a profound rumination on time, displacement and the dislocation of war. It is also monumental. There is nothing remotely comparable in Warhol’s art which seems instead determinedly to reflect the transience and immediacy of contemporary culture. That doesn’t make it any less significant, but it does suggest how much difference there is between the two. Nevertheless the exhibition Andy Warhol and Eduardo Paolozzi: I want to be a machine starts from the proposition that they had a lot in common. Elaborating this idea, it is certainly a rich show of the work of both.\n",
      "Andy Warhol and Eduardo Paolozzi – I want to be a machine, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh ****\n",
      "There are unfamiliar early drawings by Warhol, for instance, with the smooth and practised lines of fashion plate design. Paolozzi’s early drawings, also well represented, are in contrast fierce and wild, building on the inspiration of Picasso and already using collage, the technique that defines him that he adopted from the Surrealists. He found in it a metaphor for the fragmented experience of the modern world. Warhol did something similar by constantly using the camera as the basis of his work, either translating a photographic image into a print or drawing, or just as it is, but either way stressing its detachment.  \n",
      "They did once exhibit together. It was in 1968 with three others in the Four Seasons Restaurant in New York. Both are also seen as originators of Pop Art, although Paolozzi always dismissed that suggestion with a characteristically derisive snort. He saw Pop Art as trivial. He may have been right. Nevertheless, Pop Art did evolve from an insight that, quite independently, he and Warhol shared: the old boundaries that separate Fine Art from all the other images we make are meaningless. In a kind of visual democracy, all our imagery is significant; art has to embrace that to be relevant. \n",
      "For Paolozzi, however, the modern was still linked to the past. In several works here he makes the point by collaging diagrams of modern machinery onto images of classical sculpture. In Athena Lemnia von Phidias, for example, the cylinders and crank shaft of an engine are superimposed on a Greek Athena. \n",

If both of us could get through, it would be a big night for Scottish football, no doubt about that and it’s a massive game. I don’t how many tickets we’ve got, is it a couple of thousand, but I think there might be more there. It will be a great game to be involved in as a player.”\n",
